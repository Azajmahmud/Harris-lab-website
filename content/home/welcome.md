Welcome to the **Harris Lab** at Texas Tech University! We study the interaction among hormones, behaviors, and stressors in a variety of critters. The lab is run by Dr. Breanna Harris and students play a large and important role on our team. Come see what we've been up to!

Looking for a spot on the team? We are recruiting! 

**Grad students** - Dr. Harris **does** plan to take 1-2 graduate students for fall 2024.
