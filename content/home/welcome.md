Welcome to the **Harris Lab** at Texas Tech University! We study the interaction among hormones, behaviors, and stressors in a variety of critters. The lab is run by Dr. Breanna Harris and students play a large and important role on our team. Come see what we've been up to!

**Undergrads** - We are currently full, but feel free to check back periodically for openings. 

**Grad students** - Dr. Harris **does** plan to take 1 graduate student for fall 2025.
