Are you interested in Physiology and/or Human Health? 
Need a 3-credit hour biology course for Spring, 2023? 
Would you like a health-related item for your resume/application?
Do you want the opportunity to publish a peer-reviewed case study? 
Need a letter of rec from a science faculty member who knows you well?

If you answered yes, the Undergraduate Leaching Assistant (ULA) course might be for you!

**When**: Spring Semester, 2023

**Course to mentor**: Zool 2404 - 001: Anatomy and Physiology II 

**Course to register for**: Biology 4301 – 079: Peer Mentoring in Human Physiology (a graded, 3-hr biology elective; face-to-face 3:30-5:30 PM on Thursdays).  [if you have time conflicts with this, let me know]

**Instructor/Supervisor**: Dr. Breanna N. Harris (Breanna.n.harris@ttu.edu) 

**Description**: The objective of this class is to provide mentorship and guidance in teaching, leadership, and research pertaining to human physiology. Undergraduate learning assistants (ULAs), in addition to Dr. Harris and the graduate teaching assistants, are part of the educational team. Zoology 2404 is a large (~ 300 student) lecture that incorporates active learning and case studies. ULAs are fundamental in executing active learning exercises. ULAs will receive instruction on assignments, and on implementing effective mentoring strategies that will directly translate to career-oriented skills.  The ULA course syllabus is partially built by the ULAs, and students are active participants in the teaching and presentation of material each week. 

**Duties**: Attend weekly ULA meetings (Thursdays); complete active learning/case study material prior to ULA meeting; read posted articles for ULA discussion; participate in meeting discussions; attend 1 Zool 2404 discussion section per week; mentor lecture students during active learning sessions; be an active, cooperative, professional member of our educational team.  ULAs will also be asked to work in pairs/small groups to develop teaching material and case studies. Attending Zool 2404 lectures is preferred and strongly suggested.  

**Time Commitment**: ULAs are required to attend one 2404 discussion section (M, T, or W; 4-5:50 PM), attend a weekly ULA course meeting (TH 3:30-5:30 PM), and complete weekly assignments. Biol 4301 is a 3 credit hour course and as per University estimates, students should expect to spend 9-12 hrs on the course (traditionally, 3 hr in class and 6-9 hrs outside of class - for us the "in-class" portion is the discussion section and the ULA course). ULAs will get active learning material ahead of time and should complete those activities prior to our weekly meeting (so we can discuss the answers and mentoring strategies). There will also be a reflection paper about your experience as a ULA.  If ULAs stay on top of duties, attend class/meetings, and behave responsibly and professionally it should be easy to earn an A. 

**Prerequisites**: To be considered for the ULA position, students need to have earned a B or higher in Anatomy and Physiology II; OR, a B or above in a comparable course (e.g., Comparative Physiology; Animal Physiology; Endocrinology; etc.). BIOL 1404 or 1402 desired, but not required. If you don’t meet all requirement but think you might be qualified due to experience or other courses, please apply!

**Benefits**: Participate in a teaching and mentoring team; work on organization, management, and professional skills; gain a deeper understanding of physiology; practice mentoring and communication skills; experience education from the other side; gain experience for medical/graduate school; earn 3 credits that count towards your GPA; gain opportunity for letter of recommendation (from Dr. Harris); gain opportunity to author/co-author and submit a case study for publication (>30 former ULAs are published case-study authors!).
