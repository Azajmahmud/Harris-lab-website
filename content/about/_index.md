Broadly, my program of research addresses how stressors influence organismal physiology and behavior.

The study of stress spans levels of organization, from cells to ecosystems, and encompasses multiple fields of science, including behavioral endocrinology, cell biology, genetics, ecology, evolution, medicine, and psychology.
