bio: I grew up in Minnesota. There I attended the University of St. Thomas where I earned my B.S. in Neuroscience. During undergrad, I did research in behavioral neuroendocrinology. Through a program on campus, I was able to work with inner-city schools to teach kids about college. At TTU, I am looking forward to learning more about experimental design, conducting research, and presenting information in an engaging way. I joined the lab team in Fall, 2023 as a PhD student.
