Hey! My name is Jaden Hendrix, and I am from San Angelo, Tx but lived in Lubbock for most of my life. I got my A.S. in Pre-Physical Therapy from South Plains Collage and finished my B.S. in Biology at TTU. I was fortunate enough during my undergraduate degree to be a part of the TrUE Scholars, Plains Bridges to the Baccalaureate, and Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) programs that allowed me to do undergraduate research at TTU in Cancer Biology. I am currently a Research Aide/Lab Technician for the Harris Lab and have loved every second of it! I am very eager to continue my learning in Stress and Endocrinology each day that I am here. With an amazing team and PI, I will continue to excel in my field and hopefully one day go back for a Masters or Ph.D.!
